* Added changelogs
    * All notable changes to CyberTasks will be documented in these changelogs! When a new changelog is published, it'll appear automatically the next time you open CyberTasks, and you can view all changelogs by choosing the **Changelogs** option in your profile menu.

All changes before this point aren't clearly documented. The best place to view these earlier changes is by looking at [the GitHub repo's commit history](https://github.com/CyberGen49/CyberTasks/commits/main), where each commit is accompanied by a short message describing the changes. Before a certain point, however, commit messages only contain the date they were made, since too many separate changes took place at that time.
