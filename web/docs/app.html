                    <p>The CyberTasks API works just like any run-of-the-mill REST API, meaning that you can interact with it using the HTTP requesting features of your favourite programming language. Each API endpoint only works with its listed method, so be sure you're using the correct methods in your code.</p>

                        As a general rule of thumb for all REST APIs:<br>
                        <span class="methodTag get"></span> requests are for getting resources,<br>
                        <span class="methodTag post"></span> requests are for creating resources,<br>
                        <span class="methodTag put"></span> requests are for editing resources, and<br>
                        <span class="methodTag delete"></span> requests are for deleting resources.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Path parameters</b> refer to segments of the API endpoint path that contain dynamic data, like IDs. These are indicated by less than (<code>&lt;</code>) and greater than (<code>&gt;</code>) signs, which shouldn't be included as part of your final request.</p>
                    <p><b>Query parameters</b> refer to key-value pairs placed at the end of the URL, after a question mark (<code>?</code>), separated by ampersands (<code>&</code>). Example: <code>/path/to/endpoint?a=foo&b=bar</code></p>
                    <p><b>JSON body parameters</b> refer to parameters that are passed as a JSON string contained within the request body. A JSON body is required for all <span class="methodTag post"></span> and <span class="methodTag put"></span> requests. Additionally, these requests are expected to have a <code>Content-Type</code> header of <code>application/json</code>.</p>
                    <p>The API responds to requests with a JSON body containing status information along with the requested data. This response body is intended to be parsed and accessed as an object in your programing language.</p>

                    <h2>Authentication</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="body">
                    <p>Most of the CyberTasks API requires authentication, which can be accomplished by using an API key. The endpoints that require authentication are marked with an <span class="methodTag auth"></span> badge below.</p>
                    <h4>Creating an API key</h4>
                    <p>You can create an API key by signing into CyberTasks, then navigating to settings and locating the <b>API keys</b> section. From here, create a new key by clicking the <b>Create key</b> button, or modify the attributes of existing keys.</p>
                    <p>For security reasons, you'll select a list of scopes for each API key, corresponding to the API endpoints that you want to use. You can see each endpoint's scope below.</p>
                    <h4>Using your API key to authenticate requests</h4>
                    <p>Authenticating API requests is accomplished through the use of custom HTTP headers. Set the <code>CyberTasks-Key</code> header of your request to your API key to authenticate.</p>
                    <h4>Authenticating with a user access token (not recommended)</h4>
                    <p>It's also possible to gain unrestricted access to the API (including undocumented endpoints) by using a user access token for authentication. This token can be acquired by right-clicking or long-pressing on your profile picture within CyberTasks, and choosing the <b>Copy access token...</b> option.</p>
                    <p>Note that these tokens are login-specific, are deleted when you log out, and expire if left unused for 30 days. They're also able to perform potentially dangerous actions like deleting your account, so use a normal API key if at all possible.</p>
                    <p>To authenticate with a user token, use the same custom header method as above, but with the <code>CyberTasks-Token</code> header instead.</p>
